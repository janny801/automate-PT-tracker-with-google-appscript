# Google Sheets Membership Points Tracker

This script automates tracking and updating membership points for users based on Google Form submissions. It retrieves form data, updates the main tracking sheet, and ensures duplicate entries do not add extra points. Additionally, a car ride feature can be added for bonus points.

## Features

- **Automatic Data Retrieval**: Extracts form responses from the last submitted row.
- **Points Tracking**: Updates the main sheet with points for each participant.
- **New User Handling**: Adds a new row if a user is not already listed.
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Ensures multiple submissions for the same event do not give extra points.
- **Name Normalization**: Converts names to lowercase and trims whitespace for consistency.

1. A Google Form is created for each event.
2. The script extracts the latest form response from the Google Sheet.
3. It checks if the participant is already in the main sheet:
   - If found, their points are incremented.
   - If not, a new row is created with their details.
4. Name standardization prevents case-sensitive duplicates.
5. A separate script may be needed to track usersâ€™ event attendance over time.
